### Git та GitHub
I've been using Git for a while now, but these lessons made me more confident.  
Knowing what exactly and why I'm doing made me less scared to make a mistake,  
because previously a lot of commands were just learned, but not fully understood.  
And now the development process got a new dimension of better planning.
