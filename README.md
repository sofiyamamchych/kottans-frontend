## Git та GitHub
I've been using Git for a while now, but these lessons made me more confident.  
Knowing what exactly and why I'm doing made me less scared to make a mistake,  
because previously a lot of commands were just learned, but not fully understood.  
And now the development process got a new dimension of better planning.

**Linux Survival** is excellent! I've already noticed that there's no point in  
creating the folder with Windows interface instead of just using **mkdir**. So I'm  
planning to use more and more of it in my everyday work.  
**HTTP** is a whole new world. A lot of info in just two articles, of course it's  
not enough to learn it, but the overview is great for a start.

## Git Collaboration

Everything about rebasing, reverting, picking commits, etc. was new to me. My previous  
work with Git was based on a strong rule to avoid such situations at all costs. But still,  
they happen from time to time, glad I had time to learn more about it.
